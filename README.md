For the following problems, assume: µnCox = 100 µA/V2, VTH = 1 V.
Problem 1: For the circuit below, perform. the following calculations:
a) Find I1 when VIN =1.2 V and R1 =2 kΩ.
b) If W/L of the transistor is changed to W/L = 80/1, compute the new value of overdrive voltage (VOV) such the current I1 remains the same as in part (a).
c) Find the maximum value of R1 which ensures that the transistor remains in saturation.
d) Determine the minimum value of supply vol代 写ECE 498 MA: CMOS IC Design Problem Set # 1 Fall 2024Java
